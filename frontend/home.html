    <h1>AlphaZero: Built From Scratch</h1>
    <p class="intro">
      This project presents a full implementation of the AlphaZero algorithm. Every component — from neural network training to Monte Carlo Tree Search and the web interface — was developed from the ground up to better understand the algorithm’s inner workings.

      <h2>What is AlphaZero?</h2>
      <p>
        AlphaZero is a reinforcement learning algorithm developed by DeepMind. It learns entirely through self-play using <strong>Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)</strong> and a neural network that predicts both value and policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project implements the full AlphaZero pipeline — game logic, training loop, MCTS, and model inference — without relying on external RL libraries.
